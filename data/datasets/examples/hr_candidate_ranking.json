Consider at least three different perspectives (e.g., fast impact, long-term potential, team balance). Then output one final ranked list of candidates with a clear recommendation for each (advance / hold / reject) and a brief justification. Return the final answer in the format: Final ranking: <ordered list of candidates with decision and 1–2 sentence rationale each>.\n\nJob description: Prompt Engineer for internal AI tools.
