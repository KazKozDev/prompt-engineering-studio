      "response": "Okay, let's break down this question using your requested approach.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the general principles and concepts relevant to this topic.**\n\nThis question, \"сколько дисков у мадонны\" (how many albums does Madonna have), falls into a few key areas:\n\n* **Music Catalogues/Discographies:** Understanding that artists release albums (and sometimes other formats like singles, EPs, compilations) over time, forming a \"discography.\"  Counting these requires defining *what* counts as an album (studio albums, live albums, compilations, remixes, etc.).\n* **Data Collection & Verification:**  The information needs to be sourced from reliable databases and potentially cross-referenced.  Online databases like AllMusic, Discogs, Wikipedia, and official artist websites are common sources.  Different sources *may* disagree, so prioritization and understanding *why* they disagree is important.\n* **Language & Translation:** The question is in Russian.  Accurate translation is crucial.\n* **Cultural Context:** Madonna is a globally recognized artist.  Her discography is well-documented, but variations can exist depending on regional releases.\n* **Defining \"Disk\"**: The Russian word \"диск\" (disk) can refer to a physical CD/vinyl/record *or* an album in general.  We'll assume the question is asking about the number of albums released, not the number of physical copies sold.\n\n\n\n**Step 2: Apply these principles to the specific question.**\n\nNow, let's answer \"сколько дисков у мадонны\" (how many albums does Madonna have).  This is tricky because of the points above.  Here's a breakdown, focusing on *studio albums* as the core count, and then adding other significant album types:\n\n* **Studio Albums:** As of November 2023, Madonna has released **14 studio albums**:\n    1. *Madonna* (1983)\n    2. *Like a Virgin* (1984)\n    3. *True Blue* (1986)\n    4. *Like a Prayer* (1989)\n    5. *Erotica* (1992)\n    6. *Bedtime Stories* (1994)\n    7. *Ray of Light* (1998)\n    8. *Music* (2000)\n    9. *American Life* (2003)\n    10. *Confessions on a Dance Floor* (2005)\n    11. *Hard Candy* (2008)\n    12. *MDNA* (2012)\n    13. *Rebel Heart* (2015)\n    14. *Madame X* (2019)\n\n* **Live Albums:** She has released several live albums, including *The Virgin Tour*, *I'm Breathless* (a live album with some studio tracks), and *MDNA Live*.  Let's say around **4-5** significant live albums.\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Remix Albums:** Madonna has numerous compilation albums (greatest hits) and remix albums.  These vary greatly in content and regional release.  Around **10-15** depending on how strictly you define \"album.\"\n\n* **Soundtrack Albums:** She contributed to soundtracks like *Evita*.  Let's count that as **1**.\n\n**Therefore, a comprehensive answer, including all types of albums, would be around 29-35.**\n\n**However, if the question is simply asking for *studio albums*, the answer is 14.**  Given the straightforward phrasing of the question, **14** is the most likely intended answer.\n\n\n\n**Sources Used:**\n\n*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(singer)#Discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(singer)#Discography)\n*   [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000380561](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000380561)\n\n\n\n",
