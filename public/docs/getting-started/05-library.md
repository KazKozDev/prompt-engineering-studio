## Best Practices

### Name Your Prompts Well

 Bad names:
- "Prompt 1"
- "test"
- "good prompt"

 Good names:
- "Email Response - Customer Complaint"
- "Code Review - Python Backend"
- "Blog Summary Generator - Tech News"

### Write Clear Descriptions

Add 1-2 sentences explaining:
- What the prompt does
- When to use it
- What kind of input it expects

Example:
```
 "Explain Quantum Computing"

What: Explains complex quantum concepts step-by-step
When to use: For educational content, presentations
Works best with: Academic or technical audiences
```

### Use Tags Strategically

Don't overload with tags, but do:
- Tag the domain (topic area)
- Tag the style (technical, friendly, etc.)
- Tag the speed (quick, thorough)
- Tag the output type (explanation, code, list)

### Add Performance Notes

Document what you learned:
```
 Works great for: Customer support scenarios
 Watch out for: Very long customer messages (add length limit)
 Quality score: 87/100 from evaluation
 Tokens: ~250 average
```

## Organizing for Team Use

If sharing with team:

**Create naming convention:**
```
[Team]_[Category]_[Purpose]

Examples:
- Support_Email_ComplaintResponse
- Engineering_CodeReview_Python
- Marketing_ContentIdeas_BlogTopic
```

**Use consistent tags:**
- Agree on tag set as team
- Document in a shared guide
- Makes searching consistent

**Version your prompts:**
```
CustomerEmail_v1 (original)
CustomerEmail_v2 (improved after feedback)
CustomerEmail_final (tested, approved)
```

## Maintaining Your Library

### Regular Cleanup

Every month or quarter:
- Remove prompts you never use
- Consolidate similar prompts
- Update descriptions based on learnings
- Archive old versions

### Document Learnings

Add notes about what works:
- "Tree of Thoughts works better for creative tasks"
- "Gemini is faster than Ollama for this"
- "Adding context example improves results 30%"

### Version Control

Keep evolution of good prompts:
```
Version 1.0: Initial version
  → Get feedback
Version 1.1: Added examples
  → Score improves 5%
Version 2.0: Restructured completely
  → Score improves 15%
  → This is now Production
```
