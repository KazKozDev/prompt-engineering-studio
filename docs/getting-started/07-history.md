  Processing Time: 12 seconds
```

## Viewing History

### Full History View

Go to **History** tab to see:
- All generations (newest first)

- Filter by provider
- Filter by technique

### Single Generation Details

Click any entry to see:
- **Original prompt** - What you started with
- **All results** - Each technique applied
- **Full text** of each generated prompt
- **Metadata** - Time, provider, cost

## Using History

### Find an Old Prompt

**Searching:**
1. Type in search box
2. Search by original text
3. Results show matching generations

**Filtering:**
1. Pick date range (last week, last month)
2. Pick provider (Gemini, Ollama)
3. See only those results

### Recover a Prompt

Found an old prompt you liked?

1. Click the generation
2. Click the result you want
3. Click **Copy**
4. It's in your clipboard
5. Paste where needed

### Compare Generations

Compare how your prompts evolved:

```
Generation 1 (Oct):
"Explain AI" → 3 results

Generation 3 (Dec):
"Explain AI step-by-step for beginners" → 5 results

You can see how you improved your original prompt!
```

### Save a Historical Prompt to Library

Found a good old prompt?

1. Click generation entry
2. Click result you like
3. Click **Save to Library**
4. Add name and details
5. It's now in your library

## Analyzing Your History

### Learn What Works

Look for patterns:

**Q: What techniques appear most?**
- If Chain-of-Thought appears in many good generations
- This technique is probably good for your use cases

**Q: What providers do you use?**
- If Gemini results are consistently better
- Maybe spend more on Gemini, less on Ollama

**Q: How do your prompts evolve?**
- Look at earliest vs latest prompts
- You can see your skills improving!

### Measure Your Progress

Over time, you should see:
-  Better original prompts (more specific)
-  Fewer techniques needed (you get better at selecting)
-  Faster generations (you know what to do)
-  More saved prompts (building your library)

## Managing History

### Exporting History

Save your history as backup:

1. Go to History
2. Click **Export**
3. Choose format (JSON, CSV)
4. Download file

**Why export?**
- Backup important work
- Share with team
- Analyze in Excel/other tools
- Preserve for future reference

### Clearing Old History

History gets long over time. To clean up:

**Option 1: Delete individual entries**
- Click entry → Click Delete
- Deleted entries are gone (can't undo)

**Option 2: Bulk delete**
- Select date range: "Before October"
- Click "Delete All Before [Date]"
- Clears old history

**Option 3: Export then clear**
- Export first (backup!)
- Then delete old entries
- Keep recent only

 **Warning:** Deletion is permanent!

## History Storage

### Where is it stored?

-  Stored in your browser (local computer)
-  Never sent to servers
-  Private and secure
-  Persists across sessions

### Storage Limits

- Typically: 5-50MB for most users
- Can hold: 100-500 generations depending on size
- Unlimited with modern browsers

### If Storage Is Full

If you see "out of storage":

1. Export history (backup)
2. Clear old entries
3. Try clearing browser cache (Settings → Privacy)
4. Restart browser

## Advanced History Usage

### Analyzing Generational Quality

Track metrics over time:

```
Date          | Original Prompt       | Techniques | Saved?
Dec 1         | "Explain AI"          | 3          | No
Dec 5         | "Explain AI for kids" | 5          | Yes
Dec 8         | "Explain AI step..."  | 2          | Yes (saved better version)
```

**Insight:** Over time, you create better originals, need fewer techniques

### Building a Prompt Database

Use history as source for your library:

1. Weekly: Review history
2. Find good generations
3. Save to library with categories/tags
4. Build up your personal knowledge base

### Documenting Learnings

Add notes to history (optional):

"This generation works great for customer support"
"Gemini was 3x faster than Ollama for this"
"Tree of Thoughts + Self-Critique combo is killer"

## Tips for History

 **Export monthly** - Backup important work

 **Review occasionally** - See your progress

 **Delete very old entries** - Keep it clean

 **Save good generations to library** - Don't lose them

 **Look for patterns** - What works for you?

 **Don't delete everything** - At least backup first
