# Create Your First Prompt

Let's create your first optimized prompt. This takes about 2 minutes.

## Step-by-Step

### 1⃣ Write Your Prompt

In the **Generator** tab, write any task or question you have.

**Examples:**
- "Explain machine learning to a beginner"
- "Write a professional email declining an offer"
- "How do I debug a Python function?"
- "Summarize this article about AI ethics"

**Tips for best results:**
- Be clear about what you want
- Include context if needed
- Don't overthink it - the studio will improve it

### 2⃣ Choose Techniques

You'll see a list of techniques. Pick the ones that match your goal:

**For explanations:** 
- Chain-of-Thought 
- Analogical Prompting 
- Role Prompting 

**For creative writing:**
- Self-Critique 
- Iterative Refinement 
- Reflection 

**For complex problems:**
- Tree of Thoughts 
- Graph of Thoughts 
- Step-Back Prompting 

**Feeling overwhelmed?**
- Use **"Select All"** to try everything
- Filter by category (Reasoning, General, Coding, etc.)
- Start with 3-5 techniques

### 3⃣ Generate

Click **"Generate Enhanced Prompts"** and wait for results (usually 5-30 seconds depending on provider).

You'll see:
- **The enhanced prompt** - What the AI created
- **The technique name** - Which method was used
- **Token count** - How many tokens the new prompt uses
- **Copy button** - Instantly copy to clipboard

### 4⃣ Review Results

Each result shows:
- **What changed** - How the technique improved it
- **Why it helps** - The reasoning behind the enhancement
- **Token cost** - If you care about pricing

**Example - Original vs Enhanced:**

```
ORIGINAL:
"What is AI?"

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT VERSION:
"Explain artificial intelligence by breaking it down into steps:
1. First, define what intelligence means
2. Then explain how machines can simulate it
3. Show examples of AI in everyday life
4. Discuss current limitations
5. Finally, share future possibilities
Think through each step carefully and provide a thorough explanation."
```

### 5⃣ Try Different Combinations

Don't like the results?
- Select **different techniques**
- Modify your original prompt with more detail
- Try a different **AI provider** (Gemini vs Ollama)
- Generate again

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I want clear, step-by-step answers"
 Use: Chain-of-Thought, Least-to-Most, Step-Back

### Scenario 2: "I need creative ideas and options"  
 Use: Tree of Thoughts, Self-Consistency, Analogical Prompting

### Scenario 3: "I want the most accurate answer possible"
 Use: Self-Critique, Self-Consistency, Reflection

### Scenario 4: "I'm writing a summary or abstract"
 Use: Chain of Density, Skeleton-of-Thought, Refinement

### Scenario 5: "I need coding help"
 Use: Program-Aided, Structured Chain-of-Thought, ReAct

## What's Normal?

**Good signs:**
- Results are longer and more detailed 
- Multiple techniques produce different angles 
- Some are better than others 
- Results make sense for your task 

**Don't worry if:**
- Some results seem similar - they work differently internally
- Results are very long - you can edit them
- Not all techniques are perfect for your task - pick what works

## Next Steps

Once you have generated prompts:

1. **Try them out** - Copy a version and test it in your favorite AI tool
2. **See what works** - Use the one that gives best results
3. **Evaluate it** - Use the Evaluation Lab to measure quality
4. **Save it** - Add to your Prompt Library for later
